# Partial Implementation of Mapping Ordinances and Tweets using Smart City Characteristics to Aid Opinion Mining
## Requirements
Current ruby and bundler.
```bash
brew install ruby # or your OS's equivelant means of installing ruby > 2.5
gem install bundler
bundle
```
## Web
Launch web server and open browser at appropriate URL (often http://localhost:4567)
```bash
./web.rb
```

## Text
Either pipe a term in or supply interactively.

```bash
./tui.rb
```

## Limitation of Scope
Due to reasonable time constraints of a semester-long course and the focus on course objectives and outcomes, we are implementing the side of the paper which associates sentiment to mentions of a specific ordinance.
